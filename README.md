The main goal of object detection is to scan digital images or real-life scenarios to locate instances of every object, separate them, and analyze their necessary features for real-time predictions. 

Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are widely used for object detection. They are part of the family of region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs). These algorithms divide an image into a set of regions and apply a CNN to each region to extract features. They achieve high accuracy but tend to be computationally expensive.

Object Detection Techniques
Traditional Image Processing Techniques
Object detection can be performed using traditional image processing techniques. These methods typically don't require extensive training data and are unsupervised in nature. The popular tool OpenCV is often employed for image processing tasks. However, these techniques may lack the accuracy and robustness of deep learning-based approaches.

Deep Learning Networks
Modern object detection heavily relies on deep learning networks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field by enabling highly accurate and efficient object detection. Deep learning-based approaches leverage large datasets for training, enabling the models to learn intricate features and patterns from images. This has significantly improved the performance of object detection systems.
